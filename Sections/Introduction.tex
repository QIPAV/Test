\section{Introduction}
The following document contains the Test Plan for our project. Testing is crucial and it ensures that the system, at the end of the project and after each Sprint, meets the Acceptance Criteria specified. The Test Plan contains information about the purpose of testing, Test Strategy and how we will conduct our testing to verify our project. In addition we look at Testing Methods that we might use in upcoming Sprints.\\
\\
In Scrum, testing is done continuously in every Sprint. In an Agile mythology like Scrum, each Sprint focuses only a few User Stories or Backlog Items at the time. In a perfect Scrum Team all Team Members create and performs tests. Testing is done throughout the projects life-cycle, and it is important to test early and often.\\
\\
The person in charge of testing is recommended to work closely with the developers. The reason for this, is that when tests and test criteria are formulated early on in the Sprint, most of the tests becomes automated and therefor easier to perform. Therefor it is also important that the tester is involved in the creation of the User Stories, because they are the ones in charge of making a testable Acceptance Criteria.\\
